Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we
are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our
community to be accessible to all: whoever you are, and whatever your
background, we welcome you.

### Conduct

* Be welcoming and open-minded. Others may not have the same experience level or
background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to
contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming and courteous to others in your
interactions.

* Assume no malice. We all make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of
opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that
people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly
atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in
discussions, and making contributions.

* Be clear. Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's
hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use
clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.

* On community channels like IRC and Slack, please avoid usernames that might
detract from a welcoming environment for all.

* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour.

* Don't impersonate other people by copying their avatars, posting content under
their email addressese, using similar usernames or otherwise posing as someone
else.

* Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private
email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, or passwords. This is
also a form of harassment as it may present safety risks or other harms.

* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed by a community member, please contact one of
the core team members or any of the moderation team immediately. Whether you're
a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe
place for you and we've got your back. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming,
baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

### Contact

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior that
violates our Code of Conduct may be reported by:

* Emailing team@gitfund.io.

* Contacting moderators who are present in the venue where the behaviour is
taking place, e.g. operators in IRC/Slack channels, organisers at offline
meetups, etc.

### Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct:

* Remarks that violate our standards of conduct are not allowed.

* Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
conduct or not, are also not allowed.

* Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.

* If the warning is unheeded, the person will be "kicked", i.e. kicked out of
the communication channel to cool off.

* If the person comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
i.e. indefinitely excluded.

* Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the person if it was a
first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.

* If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up
with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about
bans in-channel are not allowed.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all public interaction spaces
where our community is present, e.g. the various IRC/Slack channels, GitHub
repositories, offline meetups/events, etc.
